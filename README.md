Welcome to my C# Book Exercises repository! This is where you can find my solutions to the exercises from the book [Programmering 2 C#]. These exercises are implemented as desktop applications in C#.

## About the Book
Programming 2 C# is a basic learning tool for upper secondary school adapted to the subject plan for programming valid from autumn 2017.

Programming 2 C# requires some programming experience, for example having read the high school course Programming 1. The book covers the areas of classes, dynamic types, error handling, windows, files, networks, and databases. The structure of the content with clear examples and exercises makes it easy to work independently. There are solutions to all revision questions and exercises, but since these are quite extensive for course 2, they can be found in the teacher's material, the teacher's web.

The book is spiral-bound for practical use on the computer. The book includes a teacher's website with solutions, test suggestions, extra tasks, and other things that facilitate the teacher's work.

## Programming 2 C# in brief:
• It is adapted to the subject plan for programming that applies from Autumn 2017
• It has a clear structure and well-thought-out exercises
• Facilitates self-study for students
• It has updated teaching material on the web
